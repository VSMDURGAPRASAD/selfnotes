git is a command 
Before using it we need to use git config --global user.name "VSMDURGAPRASAD"
And Use keyword to have a git config --list
git status for checking the status of a file
git log for those who have done commits in the code
In git diff usage 
If we click the git help log we will get a new page in google 
git diff --cached in this it will describes the complete different changes in each phase
git log -p in this it will shows the entire change in every phase
Now open a git branch name 
means git branch experimental
git checkout experimental then it will switched to that account
then git add -a
git -b checkout experimental
Question
$ git log --stat --summary
$ git log -p
